Project Cash Register:

This Java-based program simulates a cash register, allowing users to view available inventory, select items for purchase, and process transactions. The application generates a receipt upon checkout and dynamically updates the inventory based on purchases or returns made before the transaction is finalized.

Project ServerClient:

This project demonstrates a server-client communication model using Java. It exemplifies the coding standards and file formatting that I consistently apply across most of my projects, providing a clear example of the structure and clarity in my code.

Project FractionCalculator:

This Java project is a fraction calculator that enables users to input two fractions and perform four different arithmetic operations. While the program is functional, further enhancements are needed to align the code formatting with standard best practices, including detailed descriptions of each code section.

Project Gas Price Analyzer:

In this project, I developed a Java application that reads historical gas price data from a file, calculates average prices per year, and sorts the data from highest to lowest. The program offers valuable insights into price trends over time.

Project MultithreadSorting:

This Java application showcases the use of multithreading to sort arrays in ascending order. Users can either generate a random array or input their own, which the program then sorts efficiently using multiple threads.

Project StatRecorder:

Developed in Python, this program records and organizes sports player statistics into various arrays. The application then sorts the stats in descending order, outputting the playersâ€™ names and performance metrics, providing a clear overview of player performance.
