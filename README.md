Project Cash Register - Using Java, I created a program that simulates a cash register and the user is able to see the inventory available and select items they want to purchase. It also checks out the user for the items and prints a receipt to them. The program also updates the inventory if the customer buys the product or returns it back before completing the transaction

Project ServerClient - Using Java, I demonstrates an example on how a server and a client communicate with each other. This project shows the standard of coding I was taught and how I format my code files for majority of my projects.

Project FractionCalculator - Using Java, I created a fraction calculator that allows the user to enter a two fractions and perform 4 different arithmetic operations between those fractions. This project I was not able to finish formatting my code file to fit the usual standards of providing a description for what each section of code is doing.

Project MultithreadSorting - Using Java, I created a program that randomly creates an array or allows the user to create their own array. That array will then get sorted in ascending order and it uses multithreads to achieve the sorting.

Project StatRecorder - Using Python, I created a program that takes in information and data about a sports player and logs it within various arrays. It then sorts the stats in descending order, outputting the players name and stats.
