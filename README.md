Project 4, using Java demonstrates the an example on how a server and a client communicate with each other. This project shows the standard of coding I was taught and how I format my code files for majority of my projects.
Project 6, using Java I created a fraction calculator that allows the user to enter a two fractions and perform 4 different arithmetic operations between those fractions. This project I was not able to finish formatting my code file to fit the usual standards of providing a description for what each section of code is doing.
