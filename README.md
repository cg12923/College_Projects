Project ServerClient, using Java demonstrates the an example on how a server and a client communicate with each other. This project shows the standard of coding I was taught and how I format my code files for majority of my projects.

Project FractionCalculator, using Java I created a fraction calculator that allows the user to enter a two fractions and perform 4 different arithmetic operations between those fractions. This project I was not able to finish formatting my code file to fit the usual standards of providing a description for what each section of code is doing.

Project MultithreadSorting, using Java I created a program that randomly creates an array or allows the user to create their own array. That array will then get sorted in ascending order and it uses multithreads to achieve the sorting.
